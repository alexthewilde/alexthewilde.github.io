    <h2>
      This is my story (so far)
    </h2>
    
    <h3>Childhood</h3>
    <p>
      Born in 1984 close to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=passau">Passau</a>, Germany.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Got my first computer for christmas in 1990, a Commodore <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500">Amiga
        500</a>. I
      wasn't able to do much with it besides playing games and
      drawing stuff. But I was hooked on computers ever since.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I was a competitive rower during my teenage years. My highest achievement was being the runner-up at the German Indoor
      Rowing Championship. üí™
    </p>
    <p>
      At the age of 16, I incorporated my first business called "German Intertrade" from my childhood room: buy PCs on ebay
      and
      re-sell them locally
      with a margin.
    </p>
    <h3>2002</h3>
    <p>Taught myself how to program dynamic websites with PHP and MySQL in Macromedia Dreamweaver.</p>
    <p>
      Built my first website, allowing peers from school to upload pictures and comment on them. Think of it as a
      pre-facebook built as a hack on top of phpBB.
    </p>
    <p>Excited about this new skill set, I wanted to professionalize and learn TYPO3 (a popular CMS in Germany back then) to
      earn money as a "webmaster". However, I found TYPO3 to be ultra-complicated to implement and use.</p>
    <p>
      So I started to build the "alexo Impresario", a CMS that was more user-friendly and allowed me to create and operate
      websites for customers.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
      2003 - 2005
    </h3>
    <p>
      Left my parents' home and moved to Berlin to study economics (and go clubbing). Stopped going to university after 3
      weeks, realizing quickly that I was done with teachers telling me what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dedicated myself to further develop the Impresario and turn it into a viable business. However, as I was not a
      programming whizkid, I had to learn software development the hard way. With little knowledge and no guidance, things
      turned
      pretty bad.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      By the end of 2005, I didn't have a single customer and was 20k EUR in debt.
      My parents started to question my life choices. But I refused to give up and go back to university.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Fun fact: during that time, I also applied at different theatre acting schools because I wanted to learn the craft. At
      one audition in Berlin, I got rejected, and the jurors made fun of me because I was struggling to speak standard German
      without my Bavarian accent. This experience finally made me decide to become an engineer, so I would be judged on merits
      instead of appearance.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
      2006
    </h3>
    <p>
      My career took a turn for the better. I finally sold the Impresario to a few customers and started earning
      money! Within a year, I was able to pay back my debts and make a living.
    </p>
    
    <p>I remember the summer of 2006 when the World Cup took place in Germany, and people were just <i>cheerful all over the
        place</i>. It remains one of the best times in my home country, particularly in Berlin.</p>

    <h3>
      2007
    </h3>
    
    <p>As I matured as a developer, I increasingly realized the pointlessness of building a proprietary CMS. Free and
      superior open-source alternatives had been on the rise, and one, in particular, had caught my attention: Drupal.</p>
    
    <p>Killing your own product that you've poured so much time, energy and hope into hurts (even today). Yet, by
      betting my cards on Drupal, a new chapter in my career had opened.</p>
    <h3>
      2008
    </h3>
    <p>
      Fulfilled a dream of mine and went to live in San Francisco for a few months where I had one of the best times of my
      life. But the city was just too damn expensive.</p>
    <p>
      I actually went broke during this time as I lost my only client due to the global financial crisis. Had to live on
      pasta for weeks and slept on friends' couches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through my network at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Citizen_Space,_San_Francisco,_CA.jpg">Citizen
        Space</a>, I got an interview for a consultant gig at Zappos. Got flown into Las Vegas and had lunch with <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hsieh">Tony
          Shea</a> and his CTO, which felt completely unreal. I screwed up the technical interview afterwards, as I wasn‚Äôt able
        to simply say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù to some questions, instead of bullshitting the interviewer.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2009</h3>
    <p>
      With my financial situation worsening even more, I <i>almost</i> accepted a gig to work on a porn site once. Glad I
      didn't do it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Shortly after that, <a href="https://www.jaspersoft.com/">Jaspersoft</a> reached out to me and asked me for help
      with their website relaunch. This gig not only saved me financially, but it also made me grow as freelance
      software engineer, handling a US client for the first time. I've never had any trouble finding new gigs since then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in Berlin, I moved into <a href="https://members.co-up.de/">co.up</a> coworking space and became friends with
      the founders of <a href="https://www.cobot.me/en/about#team">Cobot</a>. These guys were years ahead of me with their
      development practices and introduced me to this new site called GitHub, teaching me how to create PRs, how to do test
      driven development, and encouraged me to do more public speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time I got more and more involved with the Drupal community where I enjoyed the camaraderie of other
      developers. Memories of my lonely years of working as an inexperienced solo-founder started to fade away.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2010 - 2011</h3>
    <p>
      Discovered a book about <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/66354">Flow Psychology</a>, which changed my
      perspective on life and product forever. I found a new purpose as entrepreneur in building software that would (somehow)
      help people ‚Äúlive a life in flow‚Äù and become happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea was as fluffy as it sounds, and therefore, the project wasn't going anywhere for a couple of years.
      Nevertheless, I enjoyed
      the autonomy of working on my own side projects while the freelance business kept getting stronger every year.</p>
    
    <h3>2012</h3>
    <p>
      I saw Michael Phelps swim like a demigod at the London Olympics and decided that I finally wanted to learn freestyle
      swimming myself.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When I started out, I was completely exhausted after swimming only two lanes. My coach Holger then taught me how to
      relax my arms between each stroke and keep a correct posture, which made all the difference.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      By the end of 2012, I did my first short-distance triathlon in the open sea in Barcelona. My biggest athletic
      achievement ever since the rowing championship in 2000.
    </p>
    
    <h3>
      2013
    </h3>
    <p>Just for fun, I started taking lessons with a vocal coach. These 5 or so lessons turned out to have a
      profound impact on where I would later channel my entrepreneurial energy: music.</p>
    <p>
      In the summer of 2013, I permanently relocated from Berlin to Barcelona as I was eager to live abroad, learn a second
      foreign
      language and
      enjoy the mediteranian lifestyle. Barcelona would become my home for the next 6 years and the place where I met the
      love of my life.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Instead of hanging out on the beach however, I spent the first 9 months behind a screen, cranking out code and
      building the new <a href="https://www.arte.tv/en/arte-concert/">ARTE Concert</a> website together with a team of <a
        href="https://marzee.co/">three
        other developers</a> that I had just met at a local coworking space.
    </p>
    
    <p>This gig was bigger than anything I had ever worked on before and it pushed all of us to go beyond our limits.
      Moreover, it taught me how to take ownership and work effectively in a team.</p>
    
    <p>Yet the best thing about it, was the beginning of a long and successful collaboration with <a
        href="https://kreuzwerker.de">Kreuzwerker</a>, the Berlin-based IT consultancy that had reached out to me for help
      with the ARTE Concert relaunch. Over the
      following years, Kreuzwerker would constantly hire me for more
      freelance work and give me the opportunity to grow into a leadership role.</p>
    
    <h3>2014</h3>
    <p>Motivated by the positive feedback from my vocal coach, I became more ambitious in building up a repertoire of songs
      that I
      could perform on stage. I had also learned the basics of deliberate practice for improving my skills. Before that, I
      would just perform a song from start to end, enjoying myself but not making much progress.</p>
    
    <p>However, the inconveniences of deliberate practice quickly started to frustrate me. Searching for specific sections
      in
      a song to practice, manually rewinding the player over and over again, recording myself, playing it back, taking
      notes etc. ‚Äì it wasn't a very fluid process.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        What I craved was a way to fully focus on my practice without constantly
      having to
      push
      buttons and adjust sliders, so I could enter a flow state and improve more efficiently.</p>
    
    <p>And that's when it "clicked": <i>music practice</i> was going to be the new focus of Flowra, my second attempt
      at building a software product.</p>
    
    <p>Within two weeks, I've finished the first prototype. It allowed me to loop a section of a song simply by clicking on
      the song
      lyrics. Using Flowra for the first time myself felt awesome, as it actually improved my practice
      experience. So
      I
      sensed that I might be onto
      something with this
      thing.</p>
    
    <p>At that point, I should have just released this crappy but functional prototype and start talking to other users. But
      instead...</p>
    
    <h3>2015 - 2017</h3>
    <p>I kept on building more features, in the true spirit of a developer who was afraid that his solution wasn't perfect
      and people wouldn't find it valuable enough yet.</p>
    
    <p>I was also facing a learning curve in building a Single Page Application (SPA) for the first time. The concept of
      client-side state management was new to me and the early Angular.js framework wasn't doing a particularly good job at
      preventing
      noobs from building a low-performant mess.</p>
    
    <p>Over time though, I got the hang of it and Flowra had turned into solid software. It was ready for launch!</p>
    
    <p>Moreover, Kreuzwerker contracted me to help them build a "<a href="https://github.com/kreuzwerker/DKT.flows">Zappier
        for AI services</a>". My newly gained experience from building SPAs came in handy for this. The project also
      exposed
      me to building serverless backends for the first time. I would never go back to building a Drupal website ever again.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2018</h3>
    
    <p>My daughter got born and life changed forever. Family became the most important thing in my life and all of my
      other aspirations had to take a step back.</p>
    
    <p>By the end of 2018, I relocated my little family from Barcelona to Passau. After living abroad for 6 years and being
      away from home for 15 years, I felt the need to return and live closer to my parents.</p>
    
    <h3>2019</h3>
    
    <p>Back in Passau, I moved into the <a href="https://www.innkubator.de/">Inn.kubator</a> coworking space. One of the
      coaches there encouraged me to apply for the <a href="https://www.media-lab.de/de/media-startup-fellowship">MediaLab
        Startup Fellowship</a>, a Munich-based startup
      accelerator. And Flowra got in!</p>
    
    <p>Meanwhile, I was joined by my girlfriend and a marketing intern who built an audience on social media and grew
      Flowra's
      song catalog. It felt
      wonderful to finally have a team and work on your own product full-time.
      But balancing startup work with family life was also a constant struggle.
    </p>
    
    <p>In the accelerator program, among other advancements, I learned how to interview customers. Through these interviews,
      I discovered what the product was lacking to possibly find true product-market-fit. Unfortunately, we wouldn't get the
      chance to execute on these findings.</p>
    
    <h3>2020</h3>
    <p>As a global pandemic started to shake up the world, our accelerator stopped funding us. I was quite frustrated about
      this, but had an even stronger will to continue our path.</p>
    
    <p>My girlfriend was already pregnant for the second time when this happend. But then we got the news that would turn my
      life completely upside down: it's twin boys!</p>
    
    <p>After a couple of weeks in shock, I finally got my act together and took a few hard decisions: instead of moving my
      family
      into a slightly bigger apartment, I'm going to build a house for us. For this, I need to stop working on my startup
      and start
      earning as much money as I can now.</p>
    
    <p>In July, my girlfriend and I got married, just ten days before our boys got born.</p>

    <h3>2021</h3>
    <p>The toughest year of my life so far.</p>
    
    <p>
      A two-year old toddler and two baby twins at home.<br />
      A global pandemic in full swing.<br />
      Funding, planning and supervising the construction of our new house.
    
    <p>
      All while working as the sole responsible engineer on a <a
        href="https://kreuzwerker.de/case/t-online-de-wetter-mit-cloud-native-funktionen-erfolgreich-modernisiert">website
        with 14M page views per month</a>.</p>
    
    <p>I remember falling asleep during a SCRUM meeting once with my camera turned on and waking up when everyone else had
      already left the meeting.</p>
    
    <h3>2022</h3>
    <p>Joined the excellent <a href="https://www.t-online.de">t-online.de</a> front-end engineering team for a while and
      learned how to work on large React codebases.</p>
    
    <p>Still disappointed about my departure from Flowra in 2020, I started to reflect more about my
      mistakes and
      weaknesses as an entrepreneur. Discovered
      the notion of ‚Äúproduct engineer‚Äù and read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/25238425">The Effective
        Engineer</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Received an offer from SAP to join as engineering lead of an innovation team. Working on enterprise software
      at a big tech corporation had never been on my mind until then. Yet, I was intrigued by the opportunity work in
      product innovation. All I sought, after all, was autonomy to build products on my own.</p>
    
    <p>Moreover, I felt ready to switch from individual contributor into a team lead role.</p>
    
    <h3>2023</h3>
    <p>And it turned out to be the right decision at the right time: just as capable Large Language Models hit the
      engineering mainstream in 2023, my team was set up and had the mandate to figure out what to do with this new
      technological marvel.</p>
    
    <p>We learned fast and were among the front-runners at SAP to build non-trivial prototypes.</p>
    
    <p>Yet, the biggest win this year for us was the innovation of a completely new product that leverages AI to save SAP
      customers
      time and money in their onboarding process. (I might
      get into trouble for sharing this publicly, but yolo!)</p>
    
    <p>
      Towards the end of 2023, I‚Äôve finally found some time on the side again to pick up the remains of Flowra.
      On December 23rd, I re-launched Flowra.com as Songcoach.ai.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It's a fresh start on a modern stack that allows me to build for web, iOS and Android with a single codebase.
      More importantly, however, Songcoach will serve as my personal playground to
      become
      better at product engineering.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I won't have the time to build and maintain many features. But I do have some time to talk to customers, understand
      their
      real needs and make Songcoach the best product for them. Even if it's just 10 customers who <i>love</i> the product,
      I'm
      happy AF.
    </p>

  <h2 id="how-i-work">How I work (with others)</h2>
  <p>Before I think about a solution, I make an effort to better understand the perceived problem at hand. The best
    solution doesn‚Äôt require writing any software at all.</p>
  <p>When writing code, I have the reader in mind. The person should be able to understand my implementation and design
    choices without any prior context knowledge. This manifests in good naming, good abstractions and keeping the README
    up-to-date at all times, so anyone can run the software locally.</p>
  <p>Unless the codebase is huge and has many contributors, aiming for high test coverage in my opinion is a waste of
    engineering time. TypeScript and linters have made
    developing high-quality software much more attainable, allowing you to refactor code with confidence. Automated tests
    however
    do make sense for covering the core user flows and edge cases of an application at an integration level.</p>
  <p>When I work as tech lead, one of my main concerns is to anticipate hidden complexities and avoid them wherever
    possible. I‚Äôve worked on too many codebases (some of them my own), that grew into an unmanageable mess due to lack
    of technical leadership.</p>
  <p>When I review PRs, I expect the engineer who requested my review to make my life easy by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>describing what the PR changes/fixes, including screenshots/videos if the UI is affected</li>
    <li>following our definition-of-done (functional completeness, coding conventions, test coverage, no regressions, ‚Ä¶)
      so I don‚Äôt have to spend my time on pointing out the obvious</li>
    <li>keeping PRs small but non-trivial. At SAP we are trying to create stacked PRs, but haven‚Äôt found a golden rule
      how to scope PRs yet.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I celebrate when code gets deleted from the codebase (<em>especially</em> code that I own myself).</p>
  <p>I love working with UX designers that have a genuine interest in figuring out a solution to a user problem together
    with me, bringing talents to the table that I don‚Äôt have. Especially if the designer has a knack for good
    copywriting.</p>
  <p>I enjoy working with product managers that excel at filling a pipeline of validated user problems, not writing
    ticket specs for me.</p>
  <p>I thrive working with talented junior engineers who learn fast and are good communicators by nature. Being able to
    speak english fluently and listen carefully is a must-have requirement. Being a React ninja isn‚Äôt.</p>
  <p>When I interview candidates for a position, I ask them to explain code written by them that they‚Äôre proud of. This
    usually leads into a discussion that shows me how candidates think and how well they‚Äôre able to explain their
    decisions. I get to see their development environment and I might even ask them to implement a small change in their
    project (which is fairer than some artificial live coding challenge).</p>
  <p>I expect everyone in my team to take ownership of their work. If I commit onto a feature, I‚Äôm responsible for
    bringing it into production and taking care of any regressions, regardless of the experience level.</p>
  <p>In functional teams, everybody helps each other out to achieve a common objective like a sprint goal or a release.
    This works best if the committed workload leaves room for unexpected blockers. Which in turn requires thoughtful
    planning: let‚Äôs think harder about this beforehand and come up with a simpler/cheaper solution with a similar
    impact.</p>
  <p>I&#39;m done with working in project teams that mindlessly practice SCRUM cargo cult. It makes me suffer and I
    don&#39;t want it in my life any longer. Instead, I seek to work in teams that practice something similar to the <a
      href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">Shape Up</a> approach.</p>
  <p>I enjoy the occasional public speaking engagement to represent my employer. My primary focus however is to deliver
    working software on time and budget.</p>
  <p>I am using quantitative and qualitative data to inform my decision making. But I also rely on my gut feeling,
    especially when there's not enough data available yet.</p>
  <p>I mentor and would like to be mentored. So please get in touch!</p>
  <p>I generally have a no-bs attitude and prefer candid talk. At the same time, I respect people‚Äôs feelings and make an
    effort to never criticize someone personally.</p>
  <p>I highly value receiving constructive feedback and I also give feedback and praise as much as I can.</p>
  
  <h2 id="tools">Tools I use</h2>
  <p>I work mouseless on my beloved <a href="https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/">Ulimate Hacking Keyboard</a> or the
    pretty decent MacBook Pro keyboard.</p>
  <p>To type more ergonomically (and a little bit faster), I've applied the <a
      href="https://colemakmods.github.io/ergonomic-mods/angle.html">angle mod</a> to my keyboard layout. I also tried
    and failed to adopt the <a href="https://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/">Programmer Dvorak layout</a>.</p>
  <p>Tip: I use <a href="http://typelit.io/">typelit.io</a> to relax and practice touch typing (I‚Äôve typed 10+ classic
    novels thus far. <a href="https://www.typelit.io/chapters/Animal_Farm">Animal Farm</a> was the most fun!). </p>
  <p>I code in VS Code using the <a
      href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asvetliakov.vscode-neovim">Neovim plugin</a>. I once tried
    switching to <a href="https://www.lunarvim.org/">LunarVim</a>
    for a couple of months. But configuring and maintaining devoured too
    much of my time.</p>
  <p>I‚Äôm not a VIM ninja. Yet I learned to master the 20 or so most important commands. Plugins that I rely upon (trying
    to keep them to a minimum):
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion">vim-easymotion</a>: to move faster in code</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround">vim-surround</a>: to change surrounding characters</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired">vim-unimpaired</a>: to leave normal mode less often</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/wellle/targets.vim">vim-targets</a>: to work with items in array, object etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I use <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty">Kitty</a> as my terminal. And <a
      href="https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit">lazygit</a> for a nice terminal-based GUI experience, especially
    for reviewing hunks before creating a commit.</p>
  <p>I use <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb">Vimium</a> for
    mousless navigation in the browser and <a href="https://vimacapp.com/">Vimac</a> for the same on OS level.</p>
  
  <h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>
  <p>I‚Äôm loosely following the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d93SGaf82OM&amp;t=329s">Pillars, Pipelines and
      Vaults</a> (PPV) methodology. It helps me with setting the right priorities in life and following through on them.</p>
      <p>I use <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> for all my knowledge and task management. What I like the
        most
        about
    Obsidian:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      I can think and create tasks at the same time, which is a huge deal for me.
    </li>
    <li>I can use VIM commands to navigate and edit text which keeps me in the flow.</li>
    <li>I can customize it to exactly my needs: a custom-built light implementation of PPV.</li>
    <li>It stores all my data locally in markdown files. I've used Evernote before and getting my data out of there was
      a real pain.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I have a <a href="https://readwise.io/">Readwise</a> subscription which lets me bookmark relevant articles, create
    annotations, tag and then sync these annotations automatically into Obsidian so I find them again when I work on a
    specific project, like creating a solution design or preparing a public talk.</p>
  
  
  <p>I actually consider this workflow to be a <b>competitive advantage</b> for any knowledge worker, as it will help
    you reveal relevant knowledge just when you need it.</p>
  
  <p>I also find Readwise's <a href="https://read.readwise.io/">Reader app</a> to be really well-executed and I use it on
    an almost daily basis.</p>
  
  <p>
    When I'm on the go, I send all my tasks, ideas and bookmarks as an email to myself. My (Gmail) inbox is the one inbox
    I'm checking every day. So I can be sure that nothing gets lost and will be processed later.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I use the handy <a href="https://braintoss.com/">Braintoss app</a> to make this a two-tap action.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I make an effort to unsubscribe from newsletters and automatic notifications that aren't of value to me.
    This increases the signal-to-noise ratio in my inbox and helps me with achieving inbox zero.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I've followed Cal Newport's advice and <a href="https://calnewport.com/quit-social-media/">quit social media</a>. It's
    a huge waste of time and keeps me from achieving great work.
  </p>
  
  <p>YouTube however, is where Songcoach's target audience hangs out and where I find great content. So I've installed <a
      href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/unhook-remove-youtube-rec/khncfooichmfjbepaaaebmommgaepoid">this
      browser extension</a> that removes distracting algorithmic suggestions from YouTube's UI.</p>
  <h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>
  <p>I‚Äôm proficient in TypeScript, React, Next.js and CSS/SCSS; Node and Express.js;</p>
  <p>I used to be proficient in building serverless backend systems on AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, CloudFront, ECS etc.).
    But it‚Äôs been ~2 years that I actually built something meaningful on AWS the last time.</p>
  <p>I have recently learned how to work with LLMs and build RAG systems. But I wouldn't consider myself an expert
    because of that.</p>
  <p>I currently skill up in Python, Postgres, React Native and <a href="https://tamagui.dev/">Tamagui</a>.</p>
  <p>I have some knowledge about SAP technology like BTP or UI5 which is completely irrelevant in the outside world.</p>
  <p>Skills I‚Äôll never need again:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the old MEAN stack: Angular, AngularJS, Angular Material, Loopback, MongoDB, gulp;</li>
    <li>the old LAMP stack; Drupal, PHP, MySQL;</li>
  </ul>
  <p>My mother tongue is German, although I actually speak to my kids in <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YwwDQCr7fk">Bavarian dialect</a>. I am fluent in English and Spanish. I
    understand French and Catalan, but I can't speak them anymore.</p>
  <p>I play the guitar, that is ~10 different chords and a few strumming patterns. And I learned to play the keyboard
    when I was a kid. Both instruments just well enough to accompany myself when I sing songs.</p>
  
  <h2 id="routine">A typical day in the life of...</h2>
  <p><i>6:30am</i> Iterate <a href="https://www.songcoach.ai">Songcoach.ai</a> or take 1:1 calls with my manager who
    works in pacific time.</p>
  <p><i>7:45am</i> Get kids ready for Kindergarten.</p>
  <p><i>8:15am</i> Work out, shower.</p>
  <p>I aim to work out at least 4x per week. Over time, I‚Äôve simplified my workout routine to only 3 exercises: heavy
    jump rope, elevated push-ups and pull-ups. My workouts don‚Äôt take longer than 20 minutes, but they‚Äôre intense and
    effective at burning calories and strengthening my entire body. Plus, I don't need a gym for that.</p>
  <p><i>9am</i> Job: deep work.</p>
  <p><i>12pm</i> Lunch break.</p>
  <p><i>12:30pm</i> Commute to coworking space by bike and listen to podcasts or ebooks.</p>
  <p><i>1pm</i> Job: shallow work with a mix of meetings, emails, slack and a second round of PR reviews.</p>
  <p><i>6pm</i> Commute back home and listen to music to unwind.</p>
  <p><i>6:30pm</i> Family time, chores.</p>
  <p><i>~9:00pm</i> Read book and get to sleep.</p>
  <p>I‚Äôm actually not <em>that</em> disciplined at reading books every day. I also watch stuff on Netflix or listen to
    audiobooks. Whatever works to shut down the system and get a good night‚Äôs rest.</p>
  
  <h2 id="books">Some of the books that influenced me</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/66354">Flow Psychology</a>: can you engineer a flow state?</p>

  <h2 id="personal">Personal things</h2>
  <p>I'm married to a beautiful Spanish wife with whom I raise our kids, aged 3, 3, and 5. Our family
    life
    is‚Ä¶
    intense.</p>
  <p>I don‚Äôt know how to cook and have currently no intention to change this. I actually outsourced cooking to <a
      href="https://prepmymeal.com">prepmymeal</a> and <a href="https://www.loewenanteil.com/">L&ouml;wenanteil</a> on
    workdays so I have one thing less to worry about.</p>
  <p>I‚Äôm a fan of Breaking Bad &amp; Better Call Saul. <a
      href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/vince_gilligan">Vince Gilligan</a>, whom I consider a genius writer,
    has crafted shows whose cinematography feels like watching art.</p>
  <p>I‚Äôm a history nerd. I want to understand why the world has evolved into its current state and where it might be
    headed in the future.</p>
  <p>My political views are heavily influenced by the tragedies of the 20th century. The rise of far-right parties is
    something that deeply worries me, especially in the US and increasingly in Germany, too.</p>
  <p>I‚Äôm not religious, but I respect that other people believe in their God(s).</p>
  <p>However, I do believe that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FssULNGSZIA">Tool</a> is the greatest
    contemporary heavy rock band.</p>
  <p>I saw an Ex Beatle as well as two Ex Led Zeppelin members live in concert.</p>
  <p>I‚Äôm a decent singer, although I tend to suck at karaoke.</p>
  <p>My favorite singers are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClhBXVygWbc">James Brown</a>, <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmREDIEePBU">Etta James</a>, <a

      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAlxIyvHY7I">Paul Carrack</a>, <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CytJvXbFlKU">Robert Plant</a>,
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRnFHfI7WAQ">Paul
      McCartney</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzEjp9bw4mE">Elin Larsson</a> and <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoTbDN5eNM">Sam Ryder</a>.
  </p>
  <p>Even as a 40 year old fart, I still go dance to techno in some shabby Berlin club at least once a year.</p>
